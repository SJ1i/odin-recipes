# Project: Recipes <sub>for The Odin Project</sub>

---

## Introduction

For this project, I will be making a simple HTML only website that contains a main page and several **links to** different recipes.

Each recipes will contain an **image** of the dish, brief **description** of the dish, an **ingredient list**, and the **steps** to make such dish.

## Reflection

Upon completion of the project, I have demonstrated following skill:
- use GitHub to host repository.
- use Git to `clone`, `add`, `commit`, and `push` content for version control.
- use HTML `<a>` tag to link other interal webpage.
- use HTMl `<img>` tag to embed image from external sources.
- use HTML `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<p>` tags for displaying text.
- use HTML `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` tags to create lists.
- use HTML `<blockquote>` tag and `cite` attribute to create quotation.
